# Old Programmer's Icons

Visual Studio Code icon pack â€“ no fuss, distinguishable icons for programmers with tired eyes.

## Motivation

This Visual Studio Code icon pack was born out of frustration with other icon packs, which tend to be overwhelming with variations for everything, and ending up with similar icons.

This icon pack tries to use clearly different icons for each type, easy on tired eyes.

Also, there are **no variations** for icon folders.
